# UFConvertorWidget

By using the app you will be able to convert UF (Unidad de Fomento) to Chilean Pesos with the assistance of the [MindicadorChile](https://mindicador.cl/)'s API.

# Developing notes 

While using Swift 5.2, I started by implementing the request model, the view of the application, then I was able to create a framework with  the request model, resquest response and currency convertor error files and use it to develop the widget part.

To draw the chart a use the [Cocoa Pod Charts](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Charts/2.0.9/index.html) version 2.0.9

And finally, I created units test to verify the request model.
